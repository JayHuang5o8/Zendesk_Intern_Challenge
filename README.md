- author: Shijie Huang

## Installation
No installation needed. Make sure your python version is above 3.0

## Usage
python3 ViewDriver.py

## Explaination
- TicketViewer.py: Executes all API connections and handle exceptions

- ViewDriver.py: The CTL part of the ticket viewer. Display the menu and tickets information to users. 

- TicketViewerTester.py: The testcases of TicketViewer.py. Due to most of the ViewDriver.py is the printing work, so no specific tests to ViewDriver. Use the python Unittest testing framework.
